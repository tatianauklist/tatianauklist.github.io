                                        I'm a first generation American that was born and raised in Texas. I got my undergrad degree in Economics from the University of Houston. This is where I got my first taste of community organizing and oddly coding as well. Both of which became a part of my future.

                                        After college, I made my way up to Ithaca, New York to work for an organization called Cornell Hillel. My first year and a half in New York was pretty uneventful. I was living life in a town whose unofficial slogan is "10 square miles surrounded by reality". Then COVID hit. While I was still lucky enough to have a job, I knew I needed to be back near family.

                                    <p>
                                        Soooo in June of 2021, I sold off my furniture, packed up my apartment and took off on a week long roadtrip back to Texas with my brother and my best friend. I called this my 'retirement era'. We took our time and were able to do so many things. We went to a White Sox game, saw Mount Rushmore. We adventured through Wyoming and had a blast in Colorado. This was a pivotal trip in my life and I'm so glad I took it.

                                        After my trip, I got back to Houston and started figuring out what my next phase is. I ended up getting a temporary job with another non-profit in town and started my Masters in Data Analytics. I really enjoyed the program and it helped me make sense of the world in a way that it didn't before.

                                        Today, I'm a Hacker Success Manager at Bugcrowd where I focus on analytics and the logistics side of our live hacking events. When I have a spare minute, I love developing subpar website (such as this one), traveling, eating and reading. Feel free to check out my book list for recommendations and who knows, maybe I'll have some sort of travel centered development projects in the future.
