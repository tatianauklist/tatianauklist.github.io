                Anyway, back to me. I'm a first generation American that was born and raised in Texas. I got my undergrad degree in Economics from the University of Houston. This is where I got my first taste of community organizing and oddly coding as well. Both of which became a part of my future.

                After college, I made my way up to Ithaca, New York to work for an organization called Cornell Hillel. My first year and a half in New York was pretty uneventful. I was living life in a town whose unofficial slogan is "10 square miles surrounded by reality".
