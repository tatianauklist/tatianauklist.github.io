            <p>Hello and howdy! Welccome to my 'about me' page. If you're looking for my resume, head on back to my<a href="https://tatianauklist.github.io">home page</a> and click the sticky note labeled 'Resume'.</p>
            <p>Anyway, back to me. I'm a first generation American that was born and raised in Texas.</p>
            <p>I got my undergrad degree in Economics from the University of Houston. This is where I got my first taste of community organizing and oddly coding as well. Both of which became a part of my future.</p>
            <p>After college, I made my way up to Ithaca, New York to work for an organization called Cornell Hillel. My first year and a half in New York was pretty uneventful. I was living life in a town whose unofficial slogan is "10 square miles surrounded by reality". Then in 2020, COVID hit and made life wacky. I moved back to Houston for 3 months and worked remotely, which is not an easy thing to do when your job is to literally engage students. But luckily, we were able to come back in August. </p>
            <p>That COVID year taught me that Ithaca really wasn't my place, soooo I sold off my furniture, packed up my car and set off on my retirement tour. On the tour, my brother, best friend and I set off on a week long roadtrip that took us through 10 states between New York, South Dakota, and Texas. This was the perfect 'retirement' for this time in my life.</p>
            <p>Once was back in Houston, I eased back into life finding another job in the nonprofit sector while I worked on my masters. The job was rough but taught me a lot about the kind of life I want and what I need to do to get there. Then came the most interesting phase of my life so far.</p>
            <p>In 2021, I was incredibly lucky to be introduced to and immersed in the hacker world. At first it was weird, but then it became incredibly fascinating. Since then, I've been fortunate enough to organize live hacking events across the US, got to DefCon, travel to Australia, and become friends with some of the most talented ethical hackers in the world. </p>
